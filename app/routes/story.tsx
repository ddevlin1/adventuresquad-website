                <p>It was a sunny Saturday morning at the Adventure Squad HQ. Captain Red was polishing his shield, and Blue Bolt was testing her new super-sneakers. Suddenly, the alarm rang!</p>
                <p><strong>"Emergency!"</strong> shouted Professor Gizmo from the monitor. "All the chocolate chip cookies have vanished from the neighborhood bakery!"</p>
                <p>The Squad gasped. "Not the cookies!" cried Mighty Max.</p>
                <p>They rushed to the scene. There were crumbs leading to the park. "A clue!" said Captain Red.</p>
                <p>Following the trail, they found a Squirrel carrying a giant bag. But wait! The Squirrel wasn't stealing them... he was saving them from a giant puddle!</p>
                <p>"I was just moving them to dry land!" squeaked the Squirrel.</p>
                <p>The Squad helped move the cookies back, and the baker gave them all a free batch as a reward. Another mystery solved!</p>
